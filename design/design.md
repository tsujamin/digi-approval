# Background #

The ACT Government controls large portions of land within the ACT as public unleased land, including many public parks and nature reserves that are regularly used for events. Holding an event on public unleased land generally requires a permit. Parks and City Services handles approximately 2,500 permit applications per year, covering a wide range of events. Permit applications for large events can be highly complex, involving approval from four or five other government agencies and many pages of supporting documentation.

The current software used for handling land use permits is basic and provides only rudimentary features for managing the permit approval process -- it does not provide an end-to-end system to manage applications from initial submission through to final approval. In particular, all communication with applicants and with other agencies/stakeholders is handled manually via email -- the officer handling the application must manually update the database when an applicant submits an updated document or another agency approves or rejects an application. This process is time-consuming and error-prone.

TODO Insert relevant background.

# Objective #

The objective is two-fold:

+ To develop a proof of concept system to demonstrate a workflow-based, online system for use in the assessment and approval of open space for events.
+ To present a case study to NICTA on the experience of the development.

# Outcomes #

Initially, the desired outcome of the proof of concept is that TAMS will be able to make a fully informed decision whether or not to engage in a further project to convert the prototype into a full system.

Should TAMS proceed, the desired outcomes of commissioning, developing and deploying a full system are likely to be:

+ To increase efficiency of government approval processes, especially multi-agency approvals.
+ To improve the consumer experience ... TODO


# Outputs #

There are two main outputs:

+ A proof of concept system for online assessment and approval of open space for events.
+ A case study documenting DigiACTive and TAMS' experience of the development process.

# Scope of Work #

Documented in scope document, attached. (TODO attach)

The document also details the assumptions and constraints for the project.

# Governance and Reporting #

Per the project agreement, the project is guided by the Project Board.

The project board consists of:
+ **NICTA**: Michael Phillips
+ **TAMS**: Rachel Reid
+ **DigiACTive**: Benjamin Roberts

Ongoing reporting occurs in the fortnightly project board meeting. The case study is a summative/conclusory report.

# Schedule #

The project has a soft deadline of 26 Feb 2014 (end of last task on the Gantt chart) and a hard deadline of 1 Mar 2014 (expiry of project agreement).

The project is scheduled by the Gantt chart produced by TAMS and stored on the eGovernment Cluster website.

# Budget #

The project budget is $5,000, which is available to DigiACTive for receipted expenses through NICTA.

# Stakeholders & Communication Strategy #

# Risk Management #

At this stage, the output is a proof of concept leading to an outcome of informed decision making.

## Present Risks ##

The risks to the initial outcome are limited:

**Risks:**

+ **Unexpected difficulty of technical component leading to unsatisfactory POC**
    + *Likelihood*: Very likely to occur at various points throughout project.
    + *Severity*: Potentially severe.
    + *Evaluation*: Requires action. See below.

+ **Scope creep/change**
    + This has been effectively mitigated by the signed scope document, and requires no further action.

+ **Conflict in requirements/direction from stakeholders** TODO
    + TAMS/community groups pushing in different directions due to different foci, pain points.
    + Reasonably likely in feedback stage.
    + Ultimately a governance issue?

+ **DigiACTive team newness/inexperience leading to poor performance** ...
    + *Likelihood*: Moderate.
    + *Severity*: Potentially severe.

## Avoided Risks/Out of scope risks ##
Should the go-ahead be given after the conclusion of the PoC for scoping, development and deployment of a final system, the risks would need to be reassessed. However, as it stands, the project poses low risk to TAMS:

+ **The output is a proof of concept that is not publicly accessible.** This closes off a large range of risks:
   + No confidential user data can be lost or stolen as no confidential user data will enter the system.
   + System malfunctions will not lead to embarrassment or public backlash as the system will not be open to the public.
   + System malfunctions will not lead to downtime or lost productivity internally as the system will not be used beyond a small group of testers at this stage.
   
+ TAMS is not committed to take the project further - if it is not fit for purpose or is going to be to expensive, TAMS can decide not to proceed with the project after the project agreement lapses on 1 March. TAMS is not obligated to progress the project beyond that point.
+ The DCC budget is for expense reimbursement only, and is capped at $5000. This money is managed by NICTA.
