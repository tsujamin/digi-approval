# Background #

TODO Insert relevant background.

# Objective #

The objective is two-fold:

+ To develop a proof of concept system to demonstrate a workflow-based, online system for use in the assessment and approval of open space for events.
+ To present a case study to NICTA on the experience of the development.

# Outcomes #

Initially, the desired outcome of the proof of concept is that TAMS will engage in a further project to convert the prototype into a full system.

The desired outcomes of commissioning, developing and deploying a full system are:

+ To increase efficiency of government approval processes, especially multi-agency approvals.
+ To improve the consumer experience ... TODO


# Outputs #

There are two main outputs:

+ A proof of concept system for online assessment and approval of open space for events.
+ A case study documenting DigiACTive and TAMS' experience of the development process.

# Scope of Work #

# Governance and Reporting #

Per the project agreement, the project is guided by the Project Board.

The project board consists of:
+ **NICTA**: Michael Phillips
+ **TAMS**: Rachel Reid
+ **DigiACTive**: Benjamin Roberts

Ongoing reporting occurs in the fortnightly project board meeting. The case study is a summative/conclusory report.

# Schedule #

The project has a soft deadline of 26 Feb 2014 (end of last task on the Gantt chart) and a hard deadline of 1 Mar 2014 (expiry of project agreement).

The project is scheduled by the Gantt chart produced by TAMS and stored on the eGovernment Cluster website.

# Budget #

The project budget is $5000, which is available to DigiACTive for recipted expense through NICTA.

# Risk Management #

## Risks to successful delivery of the outcomes ##

What could go wrong?

+ Unexpected difficulty. Very likely to occur at various points throughout project.
+ Scope creep/change - mitigated by signed scope document.



## Risks arising from the outcomes ##

The project poses low risk to TAMS.

+ **The output is a proof of concept that is not publicly accessible.** This closes off a large range of risks:
   + No confidential user data can be lost or stolen as no confidential user data will enter the system.
   + System malfunctions will not lead to embarrassment or public backlash as the system will not be open to the public.
   + System malfunctions will not lead to downtime or lost productivity internally as the system will not be used beyond a small group of testers at this stage.
   
+ TAMS is not committed to take the project further - if it is not fit for purpose or is going to be to expensive, TAMS can decide not to proceed with the project after the project agreement lapses on 1 March. TAMS is not obligated to progress the project beyond that point.
+ The DCC budget is for expense reimbursement only, and is capped at $5000. This money is managed by NICTA.


Overall, the project poses low risk to TAMS.
