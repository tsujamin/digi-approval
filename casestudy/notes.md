Innovation in a government context
----------------------------------

A major thing we had to adapt to is the very different way of thinking in the government space versus the innovation/start-up space.

The process we had was very linear: gather requirements, develop a design document, build the system. This is in sharp contrast to the way we are used to operating: build a prototype, present it, see how people actually use it and what they want changed, fix the prototype in response, get more feed back and so on. We would have attempted to build a minimum viable product by iteration rather than through explicit design.
