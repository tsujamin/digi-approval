Various notes for the case study

Innovation in a government context
----------------------------------

A major thing we had to adapt to is the very different way of thinking in the government space versus the innovation/start-up space.

The process we had was very linear: gather requirements, develop a design document, build the system. This is in sharp contrast to the way we are used to operating: build a prototype, present it, see how people actually use it and what they want changed, fix the prototype in response, get more feed back and so on. We would have attempted to build a minimum viable product by iteration rather than through explicit design.

**How has this worked out in practise? What was good/bad about doing it the government's way?**

### What's in a name?
Manager v delgator (even receptionist) -> we're not used to the technical business meanings.

## Premature Commercialisation is the root of all evil ##
We spent *a lot* of time doing frankly boring administrative work. We had to start a company, get a shareholder agreement, insurance, and write many, many pages of formal documents.

This has a number of knock-on effects:
 + Pre-existing SMEs have a significant advantage to teams from universities, as they have this infrastructure already. This would be worth NICTA investigating from the point of view of balancing the competition.
 + On the other hand, we all learned a lot, and acquired a huge amount of experience we would not have otherwise.
 + We spent the vast majority of the budget on things that have absolutely nothing to do with the proof of concept or case study. This was a bit disappointing and again put us at a disadvantage vis-a-vis an established SME. We would rather have spent that money on (for example) a graphic designer or User Experience specialist, as these are not skills we possess in great measure within the team.


Most frustratingly, a lot of this work was largely unnecessary. The project agreement dictated that we hold insurance, for example. This was despite the fact that, for the duration of the project, none of our work could actually cause the government direct loss (the only compensible loss per the agreement): it was a proof of concept not hosted on government servers. It can't melt a machine. It can't lose payments. It can't cause direct loss to the government, and it struggles to cause the government indirect or consequential loss. The entire insurance policy was basically a complete waste of money, brains and time.
