# DCC Challenge One (Event Approval) Project Scope #
DigiACTive 2013

## 1. Project Overview ##
DigiACTive intends to construct a workflow based approval system for use in event permit application and review. In the proposed design a workflow refers to a series of steps, each with certain criteria and a completing party, that are used to model approval processes. The system will be provided as a browser-based application built on a framework of highly portable open-source technologies. 

Within the applications several roles and interfaces exist. **Adminstrators** of the system will be able to modify and implement new workflows in-browser without the need to write additional code. **Customers** will be provided with an interface allowing new applications to be lodged, pending applications continued and completed applications reviewed. A **Manager** will have the power to delegate the processing of customers applications to various **Reviewers** within the appropriate department.

The system provides the flexibility for workflows to adapt to changing business rules and processes, a great deal of consistency in the review process and can act as a **one-stop permit shop** for both customers and directorates. A more detailed description of the systems workflow model and software stack can be found in the initial pitch outline.

## 2. Stakeholders ##
### Territory and Municipal Services (TAMS)  ###

### Shared Services ICT (SSICT) ###
### Customers ###


## 3. Inclusions ##
### Initial Proposal Inclusions ###
+ Workflow based approval system (Apropriate documentation provided at each stage, can contain other workflows, can lapse, notifications)
+ Administrator interface (create/modify workflows, display as flowcharts)
+ Manager interface (assign/reassign applications to approvers based on workflow etc)
+ Approver interface (pending applications)
+ Customer interface (potential applications, existing applications, approver contct, completed applications)
+ AV scanning + email + payment as celery jobs?
+ Authentication, authorisation, integrity, confidentiality, SSL

### After Consultation with TAMS/PACS ###
+ Reviewers should be able to request approval from 3rd parties (in and out of band)
+ Reporting/quering facilities
+ Automation of stake-holder identifaction possible
+ Soft warnings regarding optionality of permits/lack of processing time

## 4. Exclusions ##
+ Booking management/timetabling
+ Integration with ACTGOV payment system 
+ Assessment of appropriatness of land
+ Portal of ACT public land

## 5. Considerations ##
+ Will involve other uses of land (skips leasing, development)
+ Will likely require integratin with TRIM, act payment system and booking system (jump points into application process?)
