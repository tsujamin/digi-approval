Your summary of the Challenge
=============================

We want your own words here for the Challenge you decide to tackle.

Your concept of how to address it
================================
We need enough detail to be able to assess the viability, practicality, supportability, and 
costs for what you propose.

Your proposed project milestones
================================

As per above, the bake-off projects will run for approximately 3 months.

The critical dependencies
=========================

Please tell us what you are assuming, what you will need, to develop your idea into a 
proper proof-of-concept (POC) with associated case study report.

Likely costs
============

To be involved you have to be prepared to give your time voluntarily. So other than your

a maximum of $5,000. The Winning innovator is awarded $12,500, and the runner up 
$7,500.
