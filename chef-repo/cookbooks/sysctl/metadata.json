{"name":"sysctl","description":"Configures sysctl parameters","long_description":"# sysctl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/onehealth-cookbooks/sysctl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/onehealth-cookbooks/sysctl)\n\nDescription\n===========\n\nSet [sysctl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysctl) system control parameters via Opscode Chef\n\n\nPlatforms\n=========\n\n* Debian/Ubuntu\n* RHEL/CentOS\n* Scientific Linux\n* PLD Linux (not tested)\n\nUsage\n=======\n\nThere are two main ways to interact with the cookbook. This is via chef [attributes](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_attribute_files.html) or via the provided [LWRP](http://docs.opscode.com/lwrp.html).\n\n## Attributes\n\n* node['sysctl']['params'] - A namespace for setting sysctl parameters\n* node['sysctl']['conf_dir']  - Specifies the sysctl.d directory to be used. Defaults to /etc/sysctl.d on the Debian and RHEL platform families, otherwise nil\n* node['sysctl']['allow_sysctl_conf'] - Defaults to false.  Using conf_dir is highly recommended. On some platforms that is not supported. For those platforms, set this to true and the cookbook will rewrite the /etc/sysctl.conf file directly with the params provided. Be sure to save any local edits of /etc/sysctl.conf before enabling this to avoid losing them.\n\n## LWRP\n\n### sysctl_param\n\nActions\n\n- apply (default)\n- remove\n- nothing\n\nAttributes\n\n- key\n- value\n\n## Examples\n\n    # set vm.swapiness to 20 via attributes\n\n    node.default['sysctl']['params']['vm']['swappiness'] = 20\n\n    # set vm.swapiness to 20 via sysctl_param LWRP\n    sysctl_param 'vm.swappiness' do\n      value 20\n    end\n\n    # remove sysctl parameter and set net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout back to default\n    sysctl_param 'net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout' do\n      value 30\n      action :remove\n    end\n\n# Development\n\nThis cookbook can be tested using vagrant, but it depends on the following vagrant plugins\n\n```\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf\n```\n\nTested with \n* Vagrant (version 1.4.0)\n* vagrant-berkshelf (1.3.5)\n* vagrant-omnibus (1.1.2)\n\nTo test we have written tests in [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) and executed via [test-kitchen](http://kitchen.ci).\n\nMuch of the tooling around this cookbook is exposed via thor and test kitchen, so it is highly recommended to learn more about those tools.\nHowever, to give a quick glance at how to do some tests, you can execute the following commmands\n\n```\nbundle install\nbundle exec rubocop\nbundle exec thor foodcritic:lint\nbundle exec kitchen test default-ubuntu-1204\nbundle exec kitchen test default-centos-64\n```\n\nThe above will do ruby style ([rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)) and cookbook style ([foodcritic](http://www.foodcritic.io/)) checks followed by ensuring proper cookbook operation on two separate linux platforms (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise 64-bit and CentOS 6.4). Please run the tests on any pull requests that you are about to submit and write tests for defects or new features to ensure backwards compatibility and a stable cookbook that we can all rely upon.\n\nThis coobook is also setup to run the style checks while you work via the [guard gem](http://guardgem.org/).\n\n# Links\n\nThere are a lot of different documents that talk about system control parameters, the hope here is to point to some of the most useful ones to provide more guidance as to what the possible kernel parameters are and what they mean.\n\n* [Linux Kernel Sysctl](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/)\n* [Linux Kernel IP Sysctl](http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt)\n* [THE /proc FILESYSTEM (Jun 2009)](http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt)\n* [RHEL 5 VM/Page Cache Tuning Presentation (2009) pdf](http://people.redhat.com/dshaks/Larry_Shak_Perf_Summit1_2009_final.pdf)\n* [Arch Linux SysCtl Tutorial (Feb 2013)](http://gotux.net/arch-linux/sysctl-config/)\n* [Old RedHat System Tuning Overview (2001!)](http://people.redhat.com/alikins/system_tuning.html)\n\n","maintainer":"OneHealth Solutions, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@onehealth.com","license":"Apache v2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 10.04","debian":">= 7.0","centos":">= 5.9","scientific":">= 6.4","redhat":">= 0.0.0","pld":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{"jn_sysctl":">= 0.0.0","el-sysctl":">= 0.0.0"},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"version":"0.3.5"}
