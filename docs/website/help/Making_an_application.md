When you [log in][login] to DigiApproval, you will be taken to the [Applicant Portal][portal], where you can start or continue an application.

# How applications work

The DigiApproval system is intended to be an improvement on the traditional paper form.

With a paper form, you have to fill out the entire form in one go. It's very hard to get feedback on the way, and it's not always clear which parts of the application are applicable to you and which arent.

In DigiApproval, instead of just thinking about things in terms of forms, we have the more flexible concept of *workflows* - a set of steps that need to be taken to achieve an outcome. Some of these steps are completed by the applicant (you) and some are completed by a representative of the approving body, called the *assessor*.

When you start a workflow, you are assigned an *assessor*. Your assessor is a single point of contact who you work with through-out the application process. You can ask questions and get help from your assessor when you need it.

Once you start a workflow, there will be tasks available to you. For example, most applications start with a customer agreement. After you complete a task, other tasks may become available to you, or you may be required to wait for the assessor to complete some tasks. For example, if you upload a document, you may have to wait for the assessor to review the document before you are able to proceed.

DigiApproval keeps everyone up to date with the status of your application. Whenever you complete a task, the assessor will be sent an email. Likewise, when the assessor completes a task, you will be sent an email.

You see the status of your applications, and start work on new applications from the [applicant portal][portal].

# The applicant portal

The applicant portal has 3 sections - your current applications and pending tasks, your completed applications, and new applications you can start.

## Current applications and pending tasks

This section shows the applications that you have currently started. Each application also shows the user that has started the application, so that you can distinguish which user within an organisation has started an application.

Under each application is a list of tasks that you can complete, if any.

## Completed applications

These are stored indefinitely to provide you with access to data you uploaded previously, should you need to access it.

## New applications

This section lists the new applications you can start. In general, you should be looking for the most general or broad category that suits your event, rather than trying to get all the individual pieces that you think you might need.

# Individual applications

On the left, you'll see the status of your application.

On the right is the correspondence register.

# Individual tasks

You will be presented with a form - the type of form depends on the task you need to complete. On the right there's information to help you complete the form. Remember that if you get stuck you can always ask your assessor.
