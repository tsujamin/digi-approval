When you [log in][login] to DigiApproval, you will see a link to the [Applicant Portal][portal], where you can start or continue an application.

The applicant portal has 3 sections - your current applications and pending tasks, your completed applications, and new applications you can start.

# Current applications and pending tasks

This section shows the applications that you have currently started. Each application also shows the user that has started the application, so that you can distinguish which user within an organisation has started an application.

Under each application is a list of tasks that you can complete, if any.

# Completed applications

These are stored indefinitely to provide you with access to data you uploaded previously, should you need to access it.
