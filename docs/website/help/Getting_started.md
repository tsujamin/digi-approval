To use DigiApproval, you need to [register an account][register] and then [log in][login].

There are two different sorts of accounts: *user* accounts, and *organisation* accounts.

A **user** account represents an individual person - an actual human being.

An **organisation** account, on the other hand, represents a group, such as a company or a community group.

Both types of account can be created from the [registration page][register]. You will need to specify a user name, email and password.

Organisations can choose which users can make applications on their behalf. These users are called "members", and can be added or removed at any time. Users can be members to any number of organisations - or no organisations at all - and this can leave organisations at any time.

## Logging in
You log in (either as an organisation or a user) through the [login page][login]. You will need your user name and password from registration.

### I have forgotten my password.

Presently we do not have any mechanisms to reset passwords. You will need to [contact us](/pages/contact_us).

## Users and Organisations: an example

Jane Citizen is a member of the community group Happy Inc. Happy Inc decides it wants to run an event.

 * Happy Inc creates an organisation account.
 * Jane Citizen creates a user account.
 * Happy Inc lists Jane as someone who can make applications on her behalf.

Jane can now make applications either as a private citizen, on on behalf of Happy Inc.

Some time later, Chris joins Happy Inc. Chris already has a user account, so and Happy Inc simply adds Chris to the list of people who can make applications on their behalf.
Later, Jane leaves Happy Inc, so Happy Inc removes Jane as someone who can make applications on their behalf.

## Changing organisational membership

Once logged in, a user can change the organisations they're a member of from the "My Organisations" link in the top menu bar. Likewise, an organisation can change their member accounts from the "My Members" link in the top menu bar. You will need to know the user name of a user to add them - this is the name they use to log in.
