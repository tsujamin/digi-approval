Welcome to the DigiApproval system!

DigiApproval is designed to improve access to ACT government permits and the like. It's currently in Proof of Concept stage for the [Digital Canberra Challenge][dcc].

DigiApproval is a *workflow engine*: it's designed to help Canberrans work through the steps necessary to get the permits they need, and provide a more efficient way for the ACT government to provide those services.
